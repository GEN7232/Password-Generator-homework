For this project I struggled quite a bit. I was able to generate random characters in each array, but then when I was concatinating the empty array with the arrays according to user choice, I recieved all four arrays in one no matter what happened despite all of my "if else" statments. I'd like to resubmit when given the chance so any constructive critism is greatly welcome.
